    <p>As a graphic designer, I have experience in working in the various Adobe Applications, such
      as:</p> 
      
    <ul>
      <li>Illustrator</li>
      <li>Photoshop</li>
      <li>InDesign</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I am looking to join a design studio, as I’m looking to add the
      experience I have already gained from previous freelance/internship work.</p>
    <p>My strengths and what sets me apart from most other designers are my age and engagement
        with online media, which allow me to have a fairly good idea as to what kind of content
        would appeal to a large array of target audiences, as I know what will catch their eye and
        engage them.</p>
    <p>I’m also confident in my ability to come up with quite a few different initial
        design ideas fairly quickly, which would help out greatly with presenting to clients what
        they want would look like and start the refinement process quickly.</p>
